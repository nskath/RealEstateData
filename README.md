# RealEstateData

An application of the HomeHarvest Python Library that allows the user to search for housing data scraped from the MLS service as well as Zillow, Realtor.com, and Redfin. Written entirely in Python with in-line HTML and CSS for the frontend. Simple way to get data from real estate websites to do regression/data analysis on home prices. Allows for historical and present data to be extracted. The HomeHarvest API dynamically updates to provide the latest and real-time data.
